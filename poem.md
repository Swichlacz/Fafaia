**_By Rupert Brooke_**

Stars that seem so close and _bright_,<br>
Watched by lovers through the night,<br>
Swim in emptiness, men say,<br>
Many a mile and year away.<br>

And yonder star that burns so white,<br>
May have died to dust and night<br>
Ten, maybe, or fifteen year,<br>
Before it shines upon my dear.<br>

*Oh!* often among men below,<br>
Heart cries out to heart, I know,<br>
And one is dust a many years,<br>
Child, before the other hears.<br>

Heart from heart is all as far,<br>
Fafaia, as start from star.<br> :heart:
